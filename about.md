I've been always driven by trying to understand the world that surround us, that's the reason why I went to the university to study Physics. Now, I am mostly interested on modelling and tackling new problems and situations, creating new algorithms and designing innovative solutions.

Currently working in the banking domain, I am in general interested in the digitalization of the user's experience in its day to day live.

I have knowledge of OOP languages such as Java (SE/EE) and C++, I know also Python, C, Cobol and SQL. I have also worked with Synergy and Git as versioning tools.

I have also a large experience in numerical algorithms and scientific simulations, together with mathematical modelling, especially by using probabilities and stochastic calculus. During my studies, I was also faced to scientific computation using distributed algorithms and libraries such as OpenMP for C. I can also use Latex to create great documents.
